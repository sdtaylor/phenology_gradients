using more realistic gradients with landsat start of season estimates from Melaas et al. 2018 data (10.1002/2017GL076933)
add non-linear spatial gradients
fixed non-linear spatial gradient reproducebility
fixed seed issues
changed mean estimate to median

added other models
removed other models and added stratum size to the weibull grid test
removed weibull buffer and added number of boxes to grid test
