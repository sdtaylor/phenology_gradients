I got past phenology data from these papers. 

### Rudbeckia hirta
Dunnell, K. L., & Travers, S. E. (2011). Shifts in the flowering phenology of the northern Great Plains: Patterns over 100 years. American Journal of Botany, 98(6), 935–945. https://doi.org/10.3732/ajb.1000363
Anderson, R. C., & Schelfhout, S. (1980). Phenological Patterns Among Tallgrass Prairie Plants and Their Implications for Pollinator Competition. The American Midland Naturalis, 104(2), 253–263.

### Maianthemum canadense
Helenurm, K., & Barrett, S. C. H. (1987). The reproductive biology of boreal forest herbs. II. Phenology of flowering and fruiting. Canadian Journal of Botany, 65(10), 2047–2056. https://doi.org/10.1139/b87-279


Dunnell et al. 2011 lists mean first flowering date for R. hirta in a table as doys 177,175,169 for the years 2008-2010.

Anderson 1980 and Helenurm 1987 have flowering onset in figures. Exact values were extracted from the figures using the [WebPlotDigitizer](https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer/). Figures and resulting data are in the respective files.
